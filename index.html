You cannot take these symbols at face value, they are just pieces of your subconscious flying around in your brain. If you want to settle things now, you need to get some alone time to let your brain relax. The people around you now have a great influence over how you are seeing yourself—and you might not be seeing yourself absolutely accurately. Reset yourself.

		<div>Good Morning Bianca</div>
		<div>Work stress is high but rewarding</div>
		<div>Your main challenges this week are between balancing your work pressures & maintaining the balance in your relationship.

The pressures at work can cause stress in your personal life so dont take those work problems home with you.

It feels as if the work load will never go away but eveything will fall into place for you towards the end of Thu.

Turn to your spiritual guides if you feel that its getting too much for you.


</div>
		<div>TODAY</div>
		<div>Creativity levels at a hight betwen now and Wed</div>
		<div> Your mind should be especially quick and agile today, and your curiosity will be piqued. Your pursuit of intellectual interests could lead to group activities where you meet others interested in the same subjects. A lot of information could come your way. You'll enjoy discussing it. New friendships and lines to other possible interests could come your way.</div>
